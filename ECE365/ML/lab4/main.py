        **For grading purposes only:**

        Do NOT change the random seed, otherwise we are not able to grade your code! This is true throughout this script. However, in practice, you never want to set a random seed like this.
        For your own interest, after you have finished implementing this function, you can change the seed to different values and check your results.
        Please use numpy library for initial random choice. This will use the seed above. Scipy library is using a different seeding system, so that would probably result in an error during our grading.

        Parameters:
        1. data     (N, d) numpy ndarray. The unlabelled data with each row as a feature vector.
        2. K        Integer. It indicates the number of clusters.
        3. niter    Integer. It gives the number of iterations. An iteration includes an assignment process and an update process.

        Outputs:
        1. labels   (N,) numpy array. It contains which cluster (0,...,K-1) a feature vector is in. It should be the (niter+1)-th assignment.
