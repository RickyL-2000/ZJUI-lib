    "However, we notice that the 3-gram language model actually performs worse than the 2-gram language model. This is due to the small size of the training corpus. A 3-gram language model is actually too complex of a model for a small training size. If our training data was larger, we would be seeing the opposite. If we trained 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram models on 38 million words from the Wall Street Journal, we will get perplexity of 962, 170, 109 respectively on a test set of 1.5 million words. "
